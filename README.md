Installation
---
Add `getgrades` and `hsrmgradeformatter` to your `$PATH` and make it executable.
Example (you need root powers for this one):
```
# wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnboehm/getgrades/master/getgrades.pl -O /usr/local/bin/getgrades;
# wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnboehm/getgrades/master/hsrmformatter.c -O /tmp/hsrmformatter.c;
# wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnboehm/getgrades/master/hsrmformatter.h -O /tmp/hsrmformatter.h;
# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/getgrades;
# gcc -o /usr/local/bin/hsrmgradeformatter /tmp/hsrmgradeformatter.c
```
You still need to create your config file before you can make a lookup.

Configuration
---

getgrades reads the file `~/.config/getgrades/config`. In this file you
need to specify your username and your password. Enter those without
quotation marks or any special character that doesn't belong to your
credentials.

Example:
```
user = myuser
passwd = mypassword
```

Usage
---
Just fire away with `getgrades` and you'll get all your grades formatted
in a table with some additional information.

Sample output:

Limits
---
As it is now this script only connects to the qis instance of the server 
of the Hochschule RheinMain, University of Applied Sciences and checks 
for the major computer science with a Bachelor's degree.
You can of course change the source code to fit your needs, but most of 
it is hardwired so you'll need to edit the code itself.

Thanks to [[@jens-na](https://github.com/jens-na)] for letting me steal some of his stuff from / get inspired by his
repository `studipget`.
